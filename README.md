# About RM-Notifier

RM-Notifier is an unofficial tool to help you stay up to date with your favourite streams and DJs on RauteMusik.
When you subscribe a DJ or an entire stream you will be notified via a push notification whenever they go live!

Although this app is made possible through the use of RauteMusik's API, it should by no means be viewed as an official app of the platform.
I currently am an active member of RauteMusik but at this point in time, this is nothing more than a personal project of mine.

If you encounter any problems, feel free to message us here:

# Documentation

In this section I would just like to clear up some things that might be confusing for new users.

## Initial setup
Upon opening the app for the first time, you will be greeted with a text similar to the description on this page.
After that you'll be greeted by a list of streams to choose from. These are all of the moderated RauteMusik channels you may subscribe to.
Once you confirm this dialog you'll be greeted with all the DJs that are currently in my database. 
Due to the high number of DJs, this dialogue contains a filter function for convenience. 

If you are not interested in subscribing to either category, you may confirm a dialog with an empty selection.
But please do keep in mind that selecting neither >=1 stream OR DJ will render the app completely useless.
Of course all of your subscriptions can be edited later.

## Upcoming & Live shows
After the initial setup is complete, you will be greeted with buttons to edit your Stream and DJ selections as well as two tabs `Live` and `Upcoming`.
The `Live` tab will display all shows that are currently live (based on your subscriptions).
The `Upcoming` tab will display the next 7 days worth of shows, based on your selection.
Due to technical limitations the information in the `upcoming` tab may be out of date by ~(x * 3min) (x being the number of moderated RauteMusik streams.
At the time of writing this delay amounts to about 69 minutes of potential delay.
